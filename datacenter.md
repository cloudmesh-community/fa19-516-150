## E.Datacenter.2a - FrankFurt 3

The required values for the various attributes has been added to the [file](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gh869zfjA4sVxL8-ga0af2_HLTTuOoD1IReuRSrbq4I/edit#gid=0)

## E.Datacenter.2.b

FrankFurt 3 Data center is handled and managed by a company called e-shelter whose parent organization is NTT communications. It is the 3rd Data Center set up by e-shelter in FrankFurt after the FrankFurt 1 and FrankFurt 2. It encloses a total area about 12000 square meters(4000 in the first and approximately 8000 in the second phase of construction). FrankFurt 3 Data center was completed by the end of 2015. It utlises a electric Power capacity of 90000 Kilo Watts.[[1]](https://www.e-shelter.de/en/location/frankfurt-3-data-center)

The main advantage of FrankFurt 3 data center is that it uses a method of hybrid cooling instead of the traditional free coolin methods. This has contributed to a reduction in the cooling costs by one-third. Furthermore, since it makes use of the renewable energy sources it has a C02 and radioactive emission of 0mg/KWh. The cost of per KW/H is around 0.2$ [[2]](https://www.schneider-electric.com/en/work/solutions/system/s1/data-center-and-network-systems/trade-off-tools/data-center-carbon-footprint-comparison-calculator/). Since the Data Center operates for 24 hours a day, it comes to around less Half a million per day and costs about 165 million per year. All these facts are as per the official website of e-shelter.

## E.Datacenter.3

 Currently reside in Bloomington(woodbridge apartments) in a town house 
 Travelling around 40 miles a week (through campus bus shuttle) 
 Do not have my own vehicle
 Will usually take one long flight, once a year
 My carbon foot-print turns out to be around 9165 lbs.

A carbon foot-print has been created and has been addded to the file [file](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gh869zfjA4sVxL8-ga0af2_HLTTuOoD1IReuRSrbq4I/edit#gid=314181983). Carbon foot-print has been calculated using [[3]](http://carbonfootprint.c2es.org/).

## E.Datacenter.4

**_others_**

Intrestingly I could find out a data center which runs or may be ran on Bio mass. Biomass can be described as a fuel which comes out when the so called waste plants and animals products are burned. These plants and animal products store the energy in the form sunlight and when it is burned chemical energy in it is released in the form of heat [[4]](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/biomass/).It is one of the oldest forms of energy whose usage began several decades ago. The vineyard data center park, located downtown of the colorado spring managed to run a data center on bio mass. 

It aimed at enivironmental friendly practices, with 100% usage of renewable energy, protection of surrounding wildlife, recycled building materials, etc. It's area is around 80000 square feet with a power cost of around 4.4 cents/KWH and a PUE OF 1.21. It was estimated that the data center would be run on 50 MW Bio mass plant. [[5]](http://www.vineyarddatacenterpark.com/),[[6]](http://biomassmagazine.com/articles/5733/proposed-colorado-data-center-to-be-powered-by-biomass)

Vineyard Data center park was in great news in 2011 and it was estimated to be completed by 2014. The facts and figures given above are also mentioned in the official website(as per 2011) but the website appears to be completely outdated. There is a very little information of whether the vineyard data center park is active or not. It appears that it ran for very days and later it tanked. 

## E.Datacenter.5:India

I would like to discuss about India's effort towards renewable sources and the changes it has bought along with it. Renewable soucres refers to the process of utilising the natural sources such as sun, wind, water etc to generate energy from. Conversion of energy from one form to another form forms a significant part. For example heat energy can be obtained form electric energy and vice versa. The replacement of non renewable energy sources with renewable energy sources has both environmental as well as economic benefits. When it comes to a nation as a whole, this benefit is highly commendable. 

India's renewable sector is the 4th attractive renewable energy market in the world. India's contibution towards the renewable sources is heading towards a siginificant increase as the time passes by. As per the stastics till April 2019, total renewable power installed in the country stands at 78.53 GW. There are various notable investements and developments in the Indian renewable energy sector. It has invested funds in many projects as well received investments from other countries and investors. 

To name a few we have, 1MW of solar capacity every hour(2018), world's largest solar park named 'shakthi shithala' was launched with an investment of 16,500 crores.The consequence of using the renewable energy sources had a tremeduous impact on people. Besides, contributing to a decerease in global warming, there was a tremendous improvement in the public health and also created many employment oppurtunities. There are various initiatives taken by the indian government such as GO Green, hydropower policy,custom benefits to houses which has solar rooftop sector, etc.[[7]](https://www.ibef.org/industry/renewable-energy.aspx)

## E.Datacenter.8: The Endurance Outage(2013)

On 2013 there was a failure in 2 network switches in a data center near Provo, Utah. Though on the outer apperance it seems that its effect would be very minimal, there was very huge consequence. The basis for all these was the concept of roll-up and convergence. This means convergence of infrastructure into few data centers. On elaborating, suppose that there are 3 different brands under a company X. All these brands are hosted under the same hosting platform, which means that failure at one point can cause the breakage of all the 3 brands at once, affecting the services of millions of customers. This is exactly the same which happened in Provo.

The company called endurance manages the hosting of many of the top companies. When the network switch failed it affected many of the brands including the 4 national brands namely BLUE HOST, HOST GATOR, HOST MONSTER and JUST HOST. The role of endurance here can given as analogy to the presently trending social media comapny Facebook. Facebook manages many of the other pages and even promotes the advertisments of many of the companies and organizations. This is also one of the sources for its high economy. 

The problem with these companies is that they dont give an insight to the customers of what's actually going on i.e they aren't very transparent. When the incident happened, there was an attempt by endurance to resolve the customer queries through Twitter. Every single attempt to resolve the situation was reported.Endurance Outage had a significant impact and showed to its counterparts and to the world the need to address single points of failure.All these past and previous experiences is what the present experts and engineers in the data center consider to avoid a data center outage.[[8]](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2013/08/05/how-did-the-failure-of-network-switches-at-a-little-known-data-center-in-provo-utah-knock-four-major-services-and-millions-of-web-pages-offline)
