The required values for the various attributes has been added to the file [file](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gh869zfjA4sVxL8-ga0af2_HLTTuOoD1IReuRSrbq4I/edit#gid=0)

## E.Datacenter.2.b

FrankFurt 3 Data center is handled and managed by a company called e-shelter whose parent organization is NTT communications. It is the 3rd Data Center set up by e-shelter in FrankFurt after the FrankFurt 1 and FrankFurt 2. It encloses a total area about 12000 square meters(4000 in the first and approximately 8000 in the second phase of construction). FrankFurt 3 Data center was completed by the end of 2015. It utlises a electric Power capacity of 90000 Kilo Watts. The main advantage of FranFurt 3 data center is that it uses a method of hybrid cooling instead of the traditional free coolin methods. This has contributed to a reduction in the cooling costs by one-third. Furthermore, since it makes use of the renewable energy sources it has a C02 and radioactive emission of 0mg/KWh. The cost of per KW/H is around 0.2$. Since the Data Center operates for 24 hours a day, it comes to around less Half a million per day and costs about 165 million per year. All these facts are as per the official website of e-shelter.

Intrestingly I could find out a data center which runs or may be ran on Bio mass. Biomass can be described as a fuel which comes out when the so called waste plants and animals products are burned. These plants and animal products store the energy in the form sunlight and when it is burned chemical energy in it is released in the form of heat. It is one of the oldest forms of energy whose usage began several decades ago. The vineyard data center park, located downtown of the colorado spring managed to run a data center on bio mass. It aimed at enivironmental friendly practices, with 100% usage of renewable energy, protection of surrounding wildlife, recycled building materials, etc. It's area is around 80000 square feet with a power cost of around 4.4 cents/KWH and a PUE OF 1.21. It was estimated that the data center would be run on 50 MW Bio mass plant. Vineyard Data center park was in great news in 2011 and it was estimated to be completed by 2014. The facts and figures given above are also mentioned in the official website(as per 2011) but the website appears to be completely outdated. There is a very little information of whether the vineyard data center park is active or not. It appears that it ran for very days and later it tanked.
